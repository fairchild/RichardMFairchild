                  <p>I really like this picture. I think it might be one of my favorites of me and my Dad. It was just a regular day, the year after I graduated from UCLA. I was driving back to the boatyard a few days a week to work on Stimble. Stimble was a 1969 39’ Westphal fiberglass sailboat, old and sturdy, with beautiful lines. It had been in storage at the boatyard for years, part of someone else’s dream deferred. It’s next step was restoration or destruction.</p>

                  <p>I was a dreaming of sailing around the world then. This old derelict beauty along the back fence had that much potential.</p>

                  <p>One week before the end of the summer working as a shipwright apprentice, my Dad helped me purchase this project. I sprinted thru that last week (before my final year at UCLA) to get it seaworthy enough for a simple trip, sailing out of the harbor and back. We did.</p>

                  <p>During my final year at UCLA we planned a grand voyage. My good friend Chris and I would both sail to the Channel Islands for a week and bring all the good friends we could fit on our 2 boats.</p>

                  <p>For several months from graduation till launch I would drive to the boatyard on the evenings and days between work, to work on Stimble. My Dad was almost always there, supporting and helping me. He was motivated to help me achieve a goal. That was a trait of his that extended beyond his kids.</p>

                  <p>The Christmas of that year Dad gave me a Maxwell VWC2500. My friends laughed at my excitement over this contraption and my specific excitement. My dad knew how important a good anchoring is. The Maxwell was a quality piece of equipment that would make it easier to anchor, and decrease the burden of a re anchor when necessary. I appreciated it every time I used it.</p>

                  <p>My Dad spent so much time on my anchoring system. We would talk over possible ways for the chain to self flake, while still keeping the chain weight as close to center as possible. We wanted it to be easy, reliable and automated. He could get swept away with the process of reaching a goal. He generally did not compromise on creating the best possible quality he could imagine.</p>

                  <p>Dad wanted his time spent productively. Helping others was productive. Tara had a red trailer. He must have discovered some improvement to it that could help her. I can’t recall for sure, but I think we added a folding lid with piano hinges.</p>

                  <p>This picture was taken while we worked on this trailer improvement together, just under the stern of Stimble. It reminds me of some of the best qualities and feelings I have for my Dad. He was just helping, because he could, and enjoyed it. I enjoyed it too.</p>

                  <p>So, for a lot of reasons, I love this picture. Me and my Dad, doing what he was, underneath a huge project he helped me accomplish that led to a great and unforgettable trip. </p>
